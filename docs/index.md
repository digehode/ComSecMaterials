# ComSecMaterials

The Materials for each week will be uploaded here!
This year we will be running docker containers for challenges on your local machine, if you need a hand [view our guide, Docker for Dummies!](DockerforDummies.pdf) Which also **contains troubleshooting advice** (I find general advice point 8 fixes most problems).

| Week  | Covered | Video |
|:-----:|---------|:-----:|
|1      |Nmap & THM|<https://www.twitch.tv/videos/772154140>|

Also, don't forget to join the competition! Find additional challenges and submit your flags here! You can work in teams of 2-4, or even by yourself, if you'd prefer. **NOTE: this is for ComSec members only** (university emails required for sign-up).
